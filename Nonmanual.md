# About the project 

The project "Fundamentals of formal properties of nonmanuals: A quantitative approach" (NONMANUAL) is funded by the European Research Council ([link to the project in the ERC Datahub](https://erc.easme-web.eu/?p=101039378)). It will run from January 2023 to December 2027.

# Summary 

Sign languages, in addition to using the hands, also use positions and movements of other articulators: the body, the head, the mouth, the eyebrows, the eyes and the eyelids, to convey lexical, grammatical, and prosodic information. This linguistic use of the nonmanual articulators is known as nonmanuals. Contrary to current assumptions in the field of sign linguistics, this project proposes the hypothesis that all sign languages use the same basic universal building blocks (nonmanual movements) but that each language is different in how it combines these building blocks both sequentially and simultaneously; languages also differ in the regularity, frequency, and the alignment properties of the nonmanuals. 

In order to test this hypothesis, the project will investigate formal properties of nonmanuals in five geographically, historically, and socially diverse sign languages using data from published naturalistic corpora of the sign languages, Computer Vision for extracting measurements of the movement of nonmanual articulators, and a statistical techniques of Non-linear Mixed Effect Modelling and Functional Data Analysis for a quantitative comparison of dynamic nonmanual contours. This will result in the first quantitative formal typology of nonmanuals grounded in naturalistic corpus data. The novel methodology proposed in this project requires testing, adjustment, and development, which constitutes an important component of the project. The developed methodological pipeline will be a secondary output enabling large-scale reliable quantitative research on nonmanuals in future. 

Finally, the established typology of formal properties of nonmanuals in the five sign languages will serve as basis for a cross-modal comparison between nonmanuals and prosody/intonation in spoken languages in order to separate truly universal features of the human linguistic capacity from the effects of the visual vs. auditory modalities.

* *We use OpenFace to measure head rotation during headshakes expressing negation in NGT (Sign Language of the Netherlands). We find that some of the phonetic/kinetic measures of headshakes correlate with their linguistic functions.*

* *We look at nonmanual marking of questions in 5 deaf homesigners from Bali. It turns out that polar questions and non-polar questions are marked by opposite directions of head movements, and this is consistent across homesigners. The analysis is based on a combination of manual annotation and extracting measurements of head tilt (pitch) with OpenFace.*

Rule-Based Methods  *Proceedings of LREC-SL 2024*. [[pdf]](\papers/Susman Kimmelman 2024 eyeblinks LSF LREC.pdf) 

* *Eye blinks are an important prosodic markers across sign languages. However, cross-linguistic research on these markers is almost non-existent. In order to enable cross-linguistic comparison, we develop and test two methods of automatic detection of eyeblinks. Both methods produce promising results.* 


Kuznetsova, A. & V. Kimmelman. (2024). Testing MediaPipe Holistic for Linguistic Analysis of Nonmanual Markers in Sign Languages. arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10367. (open access)

* *We tested whether MediaPipe 3D reconstructed model of the face is distorted in the presense of head tilts (and compare it to the OpenFace 3D reconstructed model). It turns out that both models are substantially distorted in the presence of vertical head tilts (pitches), which makes it impossible to use eyebrow distance measurements from these models without additional corrections.*

Computer Vision: A Proof of Concept. In R. Galimullin & S. Touileb. CEUR Workshop Proceedings

* *In this study, we demonstrate how Computer Vision (MediaPipe) can be applied to analyze kinetic properties in literary pieces and their non-literary retellings in Lithuanian Sign Language. For example, the graph below shows that the eyebrows move more in the originals in comparison to the retellings of the same pieces.*
