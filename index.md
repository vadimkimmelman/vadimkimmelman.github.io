# About me 

I am a linguist working primarily on the grammar of sign languages, specifically Russian Sign Language (RSL) and Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT). I am most interested in the question to what extent sign languages are similar to and different from spoken languages, that is, in the effects of modality. 

Currently I am a Professor of General Linguistics at the University of Bergen. Before 2019 I was a PhD student and later postdoc at the University of Amsterdam. 

On this website, you can find a description of my research projects, and my presentations and publications (with pdfs).
