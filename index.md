# About me 

I am a linguist working primarily on the grammar of sign languages, specifically Russian Sign Language (RSL) and Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT). I am most interested in the question to what extent sign languages are similar to and different from spoken languages, that is, in the effects of modality. 

On this website, you can find a description of my research projects, as well as almost all my presentations and publications.
